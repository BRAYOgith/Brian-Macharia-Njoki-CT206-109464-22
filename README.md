## Project Overview
This project presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a network intrusion dataset. The goal is to understand the behavior of network traffic, identify potential anomalies, and prepare the data for future use in intrusion detection and anomaly detection systems.

The analysis includes:
- Loading and inspecting the dataset  
- Cleaning and preprocessing to remove irrelevant or missing data  
- Generating descriptive statistics to summarize key features  
- Visualizing the distribution of numerical attributes and attack categories using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**

---

## Objectives
1. To explore the structure and characteristics of network traffic data.  
2. To identify and handle inconsistencies or missing values within the dataset.  
3. To visualize network attack patterns for better understanding of attack categories.  
4. To build a foundation for future machine learning–based intrusion detection systems.

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3.13**
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation and analysis  
- **NumPy** – Numerical computing  
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** – Data visualization  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive environment for running the analysis  

---

## Notebook Summary
The notebook titled **`Assignment_fixed.ipynb`** demonstrates:
- How the dataset is loaded and examined.  
- Step-by-step cleaning and statistical description of network features.  
- Visual exploration of network attacks (`attack_cat`) and key numeric attributes.  

Each section of the notebook is accompanied by clear markdown explanations describing the purpose and reasoning behind every step.
